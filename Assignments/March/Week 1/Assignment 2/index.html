        <h2>Himalaya</h2>
          Himalayas, Nepali Himalaya, great mountain system of Asia forming a
          barrier between the Plateau of Tibet to the north and the alluvial
          plains of the Indian subcontinent to the south. The Himalayas include
          the highest mountains in the world, with more than 110 peaks rising to
          elevations of 24,000 feet (7,300 metres) or more above sea level. One
          of those peaks is Mount Everest (Tibetan: Chomolungma; Chinese:
          Qomolangma Feng; Nepali: Sagarmatha), the world’s highest, with an
          elevation of 29,032 feet (8,849 metres; see Researcher’s Note: Height
          of Mount Everest. The mountains’ high peaks rise into the zone of
          perpetual snow.
